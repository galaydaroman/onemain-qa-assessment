# Assessment QA
This is assessment work for onemain.
QA automation script for site `https://www.williams-sonoma.com/`
Two scenarios is covered.


## My Notes
1. Site https://www.williams-sonoma.com/ needs a huge optimisaction to be done on front-end side. Currently its super slow, which will affect on test time run.
2. Tests aren't working in headless mode. I decided to not waste time on fixing it and focus on automation. This issue I beleive could be fixed by changing request headers in selenuim driver.
3. Specs I wrote are very specific, It will not work with every product on a site. So my work will need some additinal research and work to be done to cover all types of possible product rendrings (like different price labels, overlays, dynamic/multiple product titles).

Thank you
